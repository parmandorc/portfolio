      I am a Spanish student aspiring to become a videogame developer. I am currently studying for my MSc in Computer Games & Entertainment at <em>Goldsmiths, University of London</em>. I also have a first-class BSc in Engineering in Computer Science by the <em>Universidad Politécnica de Madrid</em>, and previous working experience includes an internship at Lurtis Rules, a company that develops AI technology tools for game studios and other companies in the creative entertainment industry.

    I am looking for a gameplay programming opportunity (specialization in AI programming is a massive plus) at a triple-A studio in the UK for a summer internship, with hopes of developing that into a potential junior position.
