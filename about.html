      I am an AI programmer with the goal of becoming an AI expert. I found my first full-time position in the games industry at <em>Ubisoft Reflections</em> in the UK, where I've had a core role in the 'ClientBots' project (an AI-driven automated testing solution used in Tom Clancy's The Division 1 & 2, presented at <a href="https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1026069/Automated-Testing-Using-AI-Controlled">GDC 2019</a>).

      I have a particular interest in systemic civilian and crowd AI for open-world games, but also have a passion for Machine Learning topics such as neural networks and reinforcement learning. As learning about all AI topics is a big motivation for me, I try keep up with the latest trends by attending or watching conferences (GDC, Game AI Meetup in London) and reading books ('Game AI Programming Wisdom' and 'Game AI Pro' series).
