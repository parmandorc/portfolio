This game was developed for the Global Game Jam 2017, during one weekend at the Goldsmiths (University of London) event. The team consisted of 3 programmers and 1 audio engineer, thus our choice to make a music-based game for the project.

The game's main idea roughly consists in the player trying to jump on stage to fix the constantly deteriorating instruments the band members are playing â€“ this affects the dynamically changing audio tracks for each instrument, which get worse on runtime as they break down. All of this while trying to avoid getting caught in the spotlight so the audience doesn't through a tomato at you and knock you off stage.

This being my first Game Jam, it was quite a success. By keeping the game's concept simple and doable we managed to finish it successfully, even with spare time to go home to sleep! In fact, all the core gameplay was done and working by the first night, and so the next two days we were able to dedicate to bug-fixing and creating all the sprites, textures and effects. This way we managed to build a quite finished game that is in a pretty polished state.
